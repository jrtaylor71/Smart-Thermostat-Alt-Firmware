### Schedule Synchronization 🔄

The thermostat supports **bidirectional schedule synchronization** with Home Assistant - changes sync automatically in both directions.

#### How It Works

**Device → Home Assistant (Inbound)**:
1. Thermostat publishes complete 7-day schedule to MQTT on startup and config changes
2. HA automation receives schedule updates automatically
3. Creates/updates 77 helper entities per thermostat (times, temperatures, enabled status)
4. Changes made on device instantly appear in HA helpers

**Home Assistant → Device (Outbound)**:
1. Change any schedule helper in HA (day/night time or temperature)
2. Automation detects change and publishes to MQTT
3. Thermostat receives update immediately
4. Schedule applies to device without manual sync

#### Setup Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare Home Assistant Files**

1. Locate HA packages directory (usually `/config/packages/`)
2. Copy `multi_thermostat_schedule_sync.yaml` from repository to packages directory
3. Generate per-device schedule package:
   ```bash
   ./generate_schedule_package.sh shop_thermostat
   ./generate_schedule_package.sh studio_thermostat
   # Repeat for each thermostat
   ```

**Step 2: Add to HA Configuration**

In `configuration.yaml`:
```yaml
homeassistant:
  packages:
    shop_thermostat: !include packages/shop_thermostat_schedule.yaml
    studio_thermostat: !include packages/studio_thermostat_schedule.yaml
```

Or use UI: Settings > Devices & Services > Packages

**Step 3: Reload in Home Assistant**

1. Go to Developer Tools > YAML
2. Click "Reload Automations"
3. Wait for reload to complete
4. Helpers should appear in Settings > Devices & Services > Helpers

#### What Gets Created

**Per Thermostat** (77 helpers each):
- 14 input_datetime helpers (times for day/night periods)
- 42 input_number helpers (heat/cool/auto temps for each period)
- 21 input_boolean helpers (enabled status for each period and day)

**Automations**:
- 1 centralized inbound automation (handles all devices)
- 77 outbound automations per thermostat (one per parameter)

**Total for 3 thermostats**:
- 231 helpers
- 1 + (77 × 3) = 232 automations
- Zero manual configuration per device

#### Multi-Thermostat Support

Add as many thermostats as you need:

```bash
# Generate packages for each device
./generate_schedule_package.sh shop_thermostat
./generate_schedule_package.sh studio_thermostat
./generate_schedule_package.sh house_thermostat
```

The centralized automation automatically handles all of them based on MQTT topic.

#### Editing Schedules in Home Assistant

1. Go to Settings > Devices & Services > Helpers
2. Search for your thermostat name (e.g., "shop_thermostat")
3. Adjust times:
   - Tap the time helper to modify
   - Change to new time
   - Change automatically syncs to device within seconds

4. Adjust temperatures:
   - Tap the number helper
   - Set new heat/cool/auto temperature
   - Publishes to device immediately

5. Enable/disable periods:
   - Toggle boolean helper on/off
   - Takes effect immediately on device
- Automatically removed when feature disabled

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Stage HVAC Operation

**How Staging Works**:

The thermostat intelligently controls 2-stage heating and cooling systems:

1. **Stage 1 Activation**:
   - When temperature crosses setpoint + swing threshold
   - Stage 1 relay activates immediately
   - Timer starts tracking Stage 1 runtime

2. **Stage 2 Activation**:
   - Requires Stage 1 to run for minimum time (Stage 1 Runtime setting)
   - Temperature must be Stage 2 Delta away from setpoint
   - Example: If setpoint is 68°F, Stage 2 Delta is 2°F, and it's heating:
     - Stage 2 activates when temp drops to 66°F or below
     - Only after Stage 1 has run for minimum runtime

3. **Staging Down**:
   - As temperature approaches setpoint, Stage 2 deactivates first
   - Stage 1 continues until temperature is within swing
   - Both stages deactivate when temperature reaches setpoint

**Configuration**:
- Enable Stage 2 Heating/Cooling in Settings tab
- Set Stage 1 Runtime: Minimum time before Stage 2 can activate (default 3 minutes)
- Set Stage 2 Delta: Temperature difference required for Stage 2 (default 2.0°)

**Benefits**:
- Prevents system short-cycling
- Optimizes energy efficiency
- Provides comfort with intelligent staging
- Protects HVAC equipment from excessive cycling

### Reversing Valve (Heat Pump)

For heat pump systems with reversing valve:

**Configuration**:
- Enable "Reversing Valve" in Settings tab
- **Note**: Mutually exclusive with Stage 2 Heating
- Reversing valve relay controls heating/cooling mode

**Operation**:
- Valve energized: Heat mode
- Valve de-energized: Cool mode
- Heat Relay 2 pin controls valve
- Automatically switches based on thermostat mode

### Hydronic Heating

For radiant floor or baseboard hydronic systems:

**Hardware Requirements**:
